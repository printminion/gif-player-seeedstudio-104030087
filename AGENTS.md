# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, etc.) when working with code in this repository.

## Git Commits

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): description`
  - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `ci`, `test`
  - Example: `fix(ota): handle esp_https_ota API difference between ESP-IDF versions`
- Each commit must be atomic — one logical change per commit.
- Do **not** add `Co-Authored-By` trailers.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the default (no-wifi) variant — no WiFi AP flag required
pio run -e seeed_xiao_esp32s3

# Build the wifi variant
PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS="-D WIFI_AP_OPEN=1" pio run -e seeed_xiao_esp32s3-wifi

# Build debug variant (no WiFi AP flag required — open AP allowed in debug builds)
pio run -e seeed_xiao_esp32s3-debug

# Flash to connected device
pio run -e seeed_xiao_esp32s3 -t upload

# Monitor serial output
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

There are no automated tests — validation is done via CI builds on GitHub Actions.

## Architecture

### Board-specific configuration via include paths
Each PlatformIO environment adds `-I boards/<board>` to its build flags. This means `#include "board_config.h"` in any source file resolves to the correct board's header at compile time — no runtime conditionals needed. Adding a new board requires: a new entry in `project.json` (source of truth), a new `boards/<board>/board_config.h`, and regenerating `platformio.ini` via `python scripts/generate_platformio.py`. Both CI workflows build their matrix dynamically from `project.json` — no workflow file edits needed.

### Library dependencies

All PlatformIO `lib_deps` are declared in `project.json` — **never edit `platformio.ini` directly**. After editing `project.json`, regenerate with `python scripts/generate_platformio.py`.

- `lib_deps` (top-level array) — shared across all boards. Always includes: `WiFiManager`, `ElegantOTA`, `ArduinoJson`. Add project-specific libs here.
- `extra_lib_deps` (per-board array) — merged into that board's env only.

### Feature flags
`board_config.h` defines `FEATURE_WIFI_PROVISIONING`, `FEATURE_OTA`, and `FEATURE_VERSION_CHECK`. These gate entire subsystems in `main.cpp`. They are controlled via the `firmwareVariants` system — the `VARIANT_NO_WIFI` build flag (injected by the no-wifi variant) causes `board_config.h` to omit all three at compile time.

### Firmware variants architecture

`project.json → firmwareVariants[]` is the single source of truth for all variant behaviour:

- **PlatformIO envs** (`scripts/generate_platformio.py`) — first entry (`_is_default = true`) gets no suffix (`seeed_xiao_esp32s3`); subsequent entries get `-{id}` suffix (`seeed_xiao_esp32s3-wifi`).
- **CI build matrix** (`dev.yml`, `release.yml`) — `jq` uses `.firmwareVariants | to_entries[]` for index-aware iteration; key 0 → no suffix.
- **Manifest** (`manifest.json`) — each build entry carries a `variant` field matching the variant `id`.
- **Web installer toggle** — shown when `VARIANTS_CONFIG` has more than one entry; first variant is the initial selection.
- `requiresWifi: false` on a variant causes `scripts/set_wifi_ap_flags.py` to skip the WiFi AP password policy check for that variant's environments.

### Web installer config system

`docs/boards_config.js` is **auto-generated** by `scripts/generate_boards_config.py` — never edit by hand. Run it after any `project.json` change:

```bash
python scripts/generate_boards_config.py
```

It emits four `window.*` globals consumed by `docs/index.html`:

- `BOARDS_CONFIG` — board list with `id`, `name`, `chipFamily`, `icon`, `sku`, `url`, `image`
- `VARIANTS_CONFIG` — variant list with `id`, `label`, `description`
- `COMPONENTS_CONFIG` — BOM components array (omitted when `components[]` is empty)
- `PROJECT_CONFIG` — installer metadata: `title`, `h1`, `subtitle`, `description`, `youtubeUrl`, `howToUrl`, `baseUrl`, `githubUrl`

Board `image` fields accept a relative path from `docs/` (e.g. `assets/boards/my-board.png`) or an absolute `https://` URL. Locally cached thumbnails live in `docs/assets/boards/`. Component images go in `docs/assets/components/`.

**Asset image requirements** — images are rendered as 52×52 px thumbnails (`object-fit: cover`):

- Format: JPEG
- Recommended size: ~120×120 px (2× for HiDPI); keep file size <10 KB
- **The generator validates that every relative image path exists on disk before writing output.** If an image is missing it exits 1 with a clear error. This check also runs as the `validate-assets` job in the PR workflow.
- Workflow when adding a new board/component with an image: add the image file to `docs/assets/boards/` or `docs/assets/components/` first, then run `python scripts/generate_boards_config.py`.

### Logging system
`include/logger.h` provides `LOG()`, `LOGF()`, `LOG_RAW()` macros. When `DEBUG_BUILD` is not defined they compile to nothing; when `DEBUG_BUILD` is defined they emit via Serial. Never use `Serial.print` directly.

### OTA channels (release vs dev)
- **Release channel**: triggered by `v*` tags → builds inject version from tag, firmware binaries attached to GitHub Release, `docs/manifest.json`, `docs/version.json`, and `docs/version/` updated on `main` branch
- **Dev channel**: triggered by push to `dev` → firmware deployed to `docs/dev/`, version string is `dev-<SHORT_SHA>`

The web installer at `docs/index.html` switches between channels dynamically. `docs/version/{board-id}.json` (one file per board) is fetched by the firmware's `version_check.cpp` at runtime for auto-update; `docs/version.json` is a legacy boards-object kept for backward compatibility.

### esp_https_ota API compatibility
`src/version_check.cpp` uses two `ESP_IDF_VERSION` guards:
- `>= ESP_IDF_VERSION_VAL(4, 1, 0)` — selects between the streaming `esp_https_ota_begin/perform/finish` API (4.1+) and the legacy single-shot `esp_https_ota()` API.
- `>= ESP_IDF_VERSION_VAL(5, 0, 0)` — attaches the ESP-IDF CA bundle (`esp_crt_bundle_attach`) for TLS certificate validation without a hard-coded PEM.

## CI/CD

### Release workflow (`release.yml`)
The `release` job checks out the `main` branch (not the tag) so it can commit the updated manifests back to `main` without rebase conflicts. Do **not** add `git pull --rebase` to the manifest commit step — it was removed intentionally.

### Dev workflow (`dev.yml`)
Deploys to `docs/dev/` on GitHub Pages. Uses `keep_files: true` so the release channel (`docs/manifest.json`) is not overwritten.
